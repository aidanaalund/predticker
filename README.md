#:crystal_ball: predticker
A web application that identifies stock patterns of publicly traded companies and speculates future values.

Our prototype currently uses the streamlit library, to run it either check out our deployed version (coming soon!) 
_or_ download webapp.py and use the command _streamlit run webapp.py_ in a Python environment of your choice with all dependencies installed.
